### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme image](assets/redmefiles/color-palette.jpg)
                        
These colors are used to make a simple but clear color scheme, in Japanese, the simpler the better. I chose pink cherry blossom pink #ffb7c5 since it represents cherry blossom. And a charcoal black #212121 for a base color for most text and color of gray #fafafa, gray98 for areas where charcoal black is hard to read, such as overlapping images.

### Typography

The main font is Karla with a fallback font of Sans-Serif in case Karla is not being imported correctly. Lato is being used for all headers with a fallback of Sans-Serif in case Lato isn't being imported correctly. These two are appropriate parings for each other.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) was used to build the wireframes to showcase the elements of the site.
