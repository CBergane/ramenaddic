## User Experience UX

### Project goals

* This website is acting like a hub for the user to educate about ramen history and direct its audience to the community.
* To give a sample of some of its content on social media.
* To provide a way for the audience to sign up for more content of their choice.

### User Story

* As an audience, it should be easy to navigate through the site and get a grip of what it is about.
* As an audience, you should easily find the user's social media profiles.
* As an audience, you should find sample content on social media easily.

### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme image](assets/redmefiles/color-palette.jpg)
                        
These colors are used to make a simple but clear color scheme, in Japanese, the simpler the better. I chose pink cherry blossom pink #ffb7c5 since it represents cherry blossom. And a charcoal black #212121 for a base color for most text and color of gray #fafafa, gray98 for areas where charcoal black is hard to read, such as overlapping images.

### Typography

The main font is Karla with a fallback font of Sans-Serif in case Karla is not being imported correctly. Lato is being used for all headers with a fallback of Sans-Serif in case Lato isn't being imported correctly. These two are appropriate parings for each other.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) was used to build the wireframes to showcase the elements of the site.
